# Your friends just showed up! Given the following array of names, 
# use a for loop to greet each friend individually.

friends = ['Sarah', 'John', 'Hannah', 'Dave']

# this is how i would do it
# friends.each do |friend|
#   puts "Hi, #{friend}!"
# end
# this works!

# for loop 
for i in friends
  puts "Hi, #{i}!"
end
# this works!
